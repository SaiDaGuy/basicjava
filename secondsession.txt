In the second session of our basic Java class, I learned the values of bits based on the number of them, the conversion tables going from bits - gigabytes. After we learned that, we learned how to find which operating system you are using. On windows, you click the windows security button and type in "winver." After we learned about the operating system of the computer, we learned how to go to task manager and find out how much memry our computer has. In my case, my computer has 32GB memory. After we learned about the computer's memory, we learned about the (C:) drive and (D:) drive. We also learned how to make folders and open the command prompt to find storage, and other things like that. Finally, we opened Eclipse Java Oxygen and created a Java project on it. We named it HelloWorld. We put in commands that at the end, made Eclipse say "Hello World."
